        <p>Great characters are not created in a vacuum; everyone needs the giant dog to their skeptical cop. Learn to create your own Push me Pull relationship with a partner. It's recommended you enroll with a partner you trust, but we can also pair up the singles in the room (character wise, not romantically. That's up to you!)</p>
        <p><strong>Danielia Donohue Reidy</strong> cut her comedy teeth (ouch) at the People's Improv Theater, the Magnet, the Annoyance, and the Upright Citizens Brigade. She has taught and coached improv since 2011 and also improvises on two of the PIT's longest running teams. Danielia has also created courses geared towards older beginner improvisers, twoprov teams, and "polite" players.  Soon she will be premiering a New York history show called "DeeTour". As a woman of a certain age (42) she was issued two cats by the government.</p>
        <p><strong>Kaitlin Fontana</strong> is a writer, director, producer, and performer and an award-winning essayist and TV writer. She trained with Instant Theater, Second City, the PIT, the UCB, and the Magnet Theaters and has traveled across North America to teach and do improv and sketch comedy. Her pilot script, Casey Can't, is the 2017 Showtime Tony Cox Episodic Comedy Award winner, she is an inaugural fellow of the WGA/Made in New York Writers Room, and a proud honoree of the Bitch List. Her improv team The Studio System is the longest running Wednesday night house team at the PIT in NYC. She was born in Fernie, BC, Canada, a distinction she shares with Rush guitarist Alex Lifeson.</p>
        <p>Kaitlin Fontana and Danielia Donohue Reidy are both halves of an improv duo called Holy Shit, It's Dee and Kaitlin. They love each other. </p>

      <h3 class='workshops'>Bio</h3>
      <p>
        Joe Bill is widely regarded as one of the best teachers of Scenic and Comedic Improvisation in America today.
      He is one of the founding members of Annoyance Theater Chicago, where for 12 years he performed and directed over 60 different
      shows. He is the Director of Corporate Training at iO Chicago and is a Guest Artist in Residence at The Second City Training
      Center where he teaches intensives in Duo Improvisation and Improvisation for Actors. Joe first learned Improvisation in

      (also called“Real Time”), BASSPROV with Mark Sutton (Annoyance Theater Co-Founding Member and Artistic Director for Training
      and Development at The Second City). The NY TIMES has said about BASSPROV: "BASSPROV refreshingly has the feel of a quiet
      character study...jokes emerge organically, using wordplay, character quirks and quicksilver wit."</p>
      <p> Joe tours all over the
      world, teaching and headlining with extremely talented Duo partners like Jill Bernard (Huge Improv Theater) in their hit
      show SCRAM!, with International Improv Legend Patti Stiles (Artistic Director of Impro Melbourne) in their groundbreaking
      show Our Play, Susan Messing (Annoyance, iO, Second City) in Messing With a Friend, with Lee White (CRUMBS – Winnipeg, Berlin)
      in their heroic Duo show PARADIGM and with David Razowsky (Host A.D.D. Comedy Podcast) in Razowsky & Bill. He’s played with
      many other Duo partners, in the U.S. and abroad, in many Festival Ensemble shows and in every improvised format and style
      imaginable. He is living his dream! </p>
      <p>Joe performs in The Del Tones, The Armando Diaz Theatrical Experience and Musical Armando
      at iO Chicago. He has played as a guest in The Scene and Chica GO-GO at The PIT in New York City, with Let’s Have A Ball
      and ASSSSCAT 3000 at UCB Theater in New York & L.A and with Kornfeld & Andrews at Magnet Theater in New York City. </p>
      <p>
      He has
      performed, directed, taught and served as an Artistic Adviser for a number of Improvisation and Comedy Theaters & Festivals
      all over North America, Europe, Australia and South Africa and at every major Improv Festival in The United States.</p>
