      <p>Great characters are not created in a vacuum; everyone needs the giant dog to their skeptical cop. Learn to create your own Push me Pull relationship with a partner. It's recommended you enroll with a partner you trust, but we can also pair up the singles in the room (character wise, not romantically. That's up to you!)</p>
      <p><strong>Danielia Donohue Reidy</strong> cut her comedy teeth (ouch) at the People's Improv Theater, the Magnet, the Annoyance, and the Upright Citizens Brigade. She has taught and coached improv since 2011 and also improvises on two of the PIT's longest running teams. Danielia has also created courses geared towards older beginner improvisers, twoprov teams, and "polite" players.  Soon she will be premiering a New York history show called "DeeTour". As a woman of a certain age (42) she was issued two cats by the government.</p>

      <p>Explore the makings of the unique style of Big Bang free-form improvisation. This mindset is built on the concept of "follow the funny" and proposes that every single moment, beat, line and movement in a show can be deconstructed and used to lead you to the next scene. During this exploration and deconstruction of content, a language and pattern are established that help define form where previously there was no form.</p>
      <p><strong>Will Luera</strong> is the Director of Improvisation at Florida Studio Theatre, Director of Big Bang Improv and serves as the Artistic Director Emeritus of ImprovBoston, Artistic Director of the Pilsen Improv Festival, Artistic Associate of the Chicago Improv Festival, Artistic Advisor to the Women in Comedy Festival and Part-time Faculty at Boston College. Will is co-creator of Healing Moments for Alzheimer’s. Will performs and teaches regularly all across North America, South America, Europe and Asia.</p>

      <p>We've all been there. That feeling of emptiness on stage; when a “yes and” feels more like a “please end this now”. This workshop focuses on empowering ourselves through commitment to physical and emotional play. Using techniques from Clown, throw your physical bodies and hearts into the deep end. Try not to think too hard about it -- it being anything. See? You're doing it again, you're thinking.</p>
